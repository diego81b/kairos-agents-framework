# Changelog

All notable changes to KAIROS Framework are documented in this file.

---

## v2.0.7 — April 11, 2026

### Added

- **[Agent Files](/agent-files)** — new page that embeds the full raw content of every agent file (13 agents) as ready-to-copy code blocks. Content is auto-synced from source files at build time via VitePress code-snippet imports — no manual drift possible.
- **Changelog contribution rule** — every modification to any agent file must produce an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Rule enforced via warning admonitions on the Agent Files page and the Agents overview page.
- Navigation updated: `Agents` top-nav entry is now a dropdown; sidebar adds **Agent Files (copy)** as a collapsible parent per agent and **Team Files (copy)** for the Team Mode section.

### Changed

- `agents/teammates/` folder renamed to `agents/team/`.
- `agents/implementer-lead.md` moved into `agents/team/` — it is Team Mode specific.
- All agent files renamed to include the `-agent` suffix consistently: `orchestrator-agent.md`, `context-extractor-agent.md`, `code-reviewer-agent.md`, `test-verifier-agent.md`, `release-planner-agent.md`, `implementer-lead-agent.md`, `teammate-*-agent.md`. Files already named correctly (`pm-agent`, `architect-agent`, `implementer-agent`) are unchanged.
- All `name:` frontmatter fields updated to match new file names.
- All `@agent-call` references inside agent files updated.
- All path and link references updated across docs and setup guides.

---

## v2.0.6 — April 9, 2026

### Added

- Version number shown dynamically in the nav bar and footer, read from `package.json` — updating the version in one place propagates everywhere automatically

---

## v2.0.5 — April 9, 2026

### Changed

- **[Claude Code Setup](/setup/claude-code)** — added complete Team Mode setup instructions:
  - Copy command and directory tree now include `implementer-lead.md` and `teammates/`
  - New section explaining why Team Mode requires Claude Code (agent spawning comparison table vs Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
  - Step-by-step activation flow with the Orchestrator cost warning
  - Visual diagram of the RED → HITL → GREEN (parallel) → REFACTOR spawn sequence
  - `agent` tool verification for `implementer-lead.md`
  - Full pipeline diagram updated to show both implementation paths

---

## v2.0.4 — April 9, 2026

### Changed

- **Implementer Lead** — restructured to apply real TDD methodology across the team:
  - **RED phase** — `teammate-tests` is spawned first; the full test suite is written against the binding contracts before any implementation exists
  - **HITL test-plan gate** — user reviews and approves the test plan before backend/frontend/database are spawned
  - **GREEN phase** — `teammate-backend`, `teammate-frontend`, `teammate-database` spawn in parallel with the explicit goal of making the pre-existing tests pass
  - **REFACTOR phase** — quality improvements coordinated across all layers, tests must remain green
- [Workflow](/workflow) and [Agents](/agents) documentation updated to reflect the three-phase TDD flow

---

## v2.0.3 — April 9, 2026

### Changed

- **Team Mode documentation** — all references to "Claude Code only" now explain the technical reason: Claude Code's `agent` tool allows an agent to spawn other agents programmatically at runtime; Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains, and Codex CLI only support user-triggered agent calls and cannot support Team Mode
  - [Workflow](/workflow) — new tool compatibility table inside the Team Mode warning block
  - [Agents](/agents) — explanation added to the Team Mode section intro
  - [Overview](/overview) — inline mention in the Team Mode paragraph
- **Overview** — removed Claude-specific language from provider-agnostic sections: `"isolated Claude instances"` → `"isolated AI agent instances"`; model names removed from the file tree

---

## v2.0.2 — April 9, 2026

### Added

- **Pipeline diagram** in [Workflow](/workflow) — Mermaid flowchart showing all 6 phases with the Phase 3 biforcation between Single Agent and Team Mode, HITL gates on every transition
- Mermaid rendering support (`vitepress-plugin-mermaid`)

### Fixed

- **Implementer Agent** — restored full agent definition: Phase 0 implementation plan (files, test cases, TDD order, risks) with its own HITL gate before any file is written; TDD phases 1–6 (generate tests → RED → implement → GREEN → refactor → coverage); model `claude-opus-4-6`; platform-specific configuration for Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code

### Removed

- `implementer-coordinator` — removed from the framework; it was not part of the active pipeline

---

## v2.0.1 — April 9, 2026

### Added

**Implementer Team Pattern** (Claude Code only, optional)

A new optional execution mode for complex multi-layer features. When explicitly requested, the Orchestrator activates a coordinated team of 5 specialized agents instead of the single Implementer Agent:

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| [Implementer Lead](/agents/team/implementer-lead-agent) | Team coordinator — creates binding contracts, spawns and monitors teammates |
| [Teammate Tests](/agents/team/teammate-tests-agent) | Test specialist — generates full test suite (RED phase first) |
| [Teammate Backend](/agents/team/teammate-backend-agent) | Backend specialist — implements APIs per contract |
| [Teammate Frontend](/agents/team/teammate-frontend-agent) | Frontend specialist — implements UI per contract |
| [Teammate Database](/agents/team/teammate-database-agent) | Database specialist — creates schema and migrations per contract |

Also added:

- **Team Mode routing** in the Orchestrator Phase 3 — shows explicit cost warning before activating Team Mode

### Changed

- **Orchestrator** — Phase 3 now routes to `implementer-agent` (default) or `implementer-lead` (Team Mode, explicit request only)
- **Implementer Agent** — clarified as the default for all features, simple and complex alike

### Cost Transparency

| Mode | Cost/feature | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Single Agent (default) | ~$0.068 | All features — works everywhere |
| Team Mode | ~$0.242 (3.5×) | Critical systems, only on explicit request |

Team Mode is **Claude Code only**. The single Implementer Agent works everywhere.

## v2.0.0 — April 8, 2026

### Added

- **7-agent orchestration pipeline** — Orchestrator, PM Agent, Architect Agent, Implementer Agent, Code Reviewer, Test Verifier, Release Planner
- **Context Extractor** — standalone pre-pipeline agent producing `00-context.json` for downstream agents
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) gates** — explicit user approval after every pipeline phase
- **Selective pipeline** — activate only the agents you need per run
- **Issue tracker integration** — Jira, GitLab Issues, Bitbucket Issues
- **Multi-tool support** — Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains AI Assistant, OpenAI Codex CLI
- **Feature folder isolation** — each run writes to `.kairos/<feature_folder>/` for a complete audit trail
- **VitePress documentation site** with full agent reference and tool-specific setup guides
- **Deployment configs** for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
