---

## [v2.0.4] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- `agents/implementer-lead.md` — restructured to apply real TDD methodology: RED phase (teammate-tests spawned first, all tests written before any implementation), HITL test-plan gate before GREEN phase, GREEN phase (backend + frontend + database spawned in parallel to make tests pass), REFACTOR phase. Added `agent` tool to frontmatter.
- `docs/workflow.md` — Team Mode description updated to reflect the three-phase TDD flow with the additional HITL gate between RED and GREEN
- `docs/agents.md` — Implementer Lead description updated to reflect RED/GREEN/REFACTOR coordination

---

## [v2.0.3] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- `docs/workflow.md` — Team Mode warning block now includes a tool compatibility table explaining *why* Claude Code is required (agent-to-agent spawning via `agent` tool) vs Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains, Codex CLI (user-triggered only)
- `docs/agents.md` — Team Mode section now explains the technical reason for the Claude Code requirement
- `docs/overview.md` — Team Mode paragraph now mentions the technical distinction inline
- `docs/overview.md` — removed Claude-specific language from "The Problem It Solves" (`"isolated Claude instances"` → `"isolated AI agent instances"`) and from the file tree (removed model name comments)

---

## [v2.0.2] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Mermaid diagram** in `docs/workflow.md` — interactive flowchart showing the full pipeline with Phase 3 biforcation (Single Agent vs Team Mode)
- `mermaid` and `vitepress-plugin-mermaid` installed and configured in `docs/.vitepress/config.js`

### Fixed

- `agents/implementer-agent.md` — restored full content lost in v2.0.1: Phase 0 (implementation plan + HITL plan gate), TDD phases 1–6, model `claude-opus-4-6`, platform configurations (Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code), `.kairos/` output, issue tracker comments

### Removed

- `agents/implementer-coordinator.md` — removed; not referenced by the orchestrator and not part of the active pipeline

---

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Implementer Team Pattern** (Claude Code only, optional)
  - `agents/implementer-lead.md` — Team coordinator (not a coder; creates binding contracts and spawns teammates)
  - `agents/teammates/teammate-tests.md` — Test specialist (RED phase first)
  - `agents/teammates/teammate-backend.md` — Backend specialist
  - `agents/teammates/teammate-frontend.md` — Frontend specialist
  - `agents/teammates/teammate-database.md` — Database specialist
- Team Mode routing in Orchestrator Phase 3 with explicit cost warning before activation
- Internal documentation guides:
  - `internal/COST-REALITY-CHECK.md` — Honest cost analysis (single agent vs team)
  - `internal/TEAM-MODE-PROVIDER-SPECIFICS.md` — Provider compatibility matrix
  - `internal/ROUTING-LOGIC-AGNOSTIC.md` — Why routing is agent decision logic, not code
  - `internal/IMPLEMENTER-TEAM-PATTERN.md` — Team pattern design rationale

### Changed

- `agents/orchestrator.md` — Phase 3 now routes to `implementer-agent` (default) or `implementer-lead` (Team Mode, only on explicit user request with cost warning)
- `agents/implementer-agent.md` — Clarified as default for **all** features, simple and complex alike
- Documentation updated to reflect the full 13-agent ecosystem (8 core + 5 team specialists)

### Notes

- Team Mode is Claude Code only; `implementer-agent` works everywhere (Claude Code, API, Local)
- Default remains single `implementer-agent` at ~$0.068/feature
- Team Mode costs ~$0.242/feature (3.5×) — only activated on explicit user request after confirming the cost warning

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- 7-agent orchestration pipeline: Orchestrator, PM Agent, Architect Agent, Implementer Agent, Code Reviewer, Test Verifier, Release Planner
- Context Extractor — standalone pre-pipeline agent that produces `00-context.json`
- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) gates after every pipeline phase
- Selective pipeline — users choose which agents to activate per run
- Issue tracker integration: Jira, GitLab Issues, Bitbucket Issues
- VitePress documentation site with full agent reference and setup guides
- Deployment configurations for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages
- Pipeline Templates in setup guides
- Multi-tool support: Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains AI Assistant, OpenAI Codex CLI
- Feature folder isolation under `.kairos/<feature_folder>/` for audit trail
